**INTRODUCTION**

Angry Birds is a popular mobile game that combines physics-based gameplay with strategic problem-solving. The goal is to launch birds using a slingshot to destroy villain birds that are hidden within various structures. These structures are made of materials like wood, slabs, and poles, and the player must damage them in such a way that the villain birds are indirectly eliminatedâ€”either by direct hits or by causing the structures to collapse.

The primary objective is to eliminate all the villain birds in a level with a limited number of birds. Success often requires careful planning, as players must consider the interactions between different objects, the building structure, and the physical properties of the materials involved.

In this stage, players control a red Angry Bird that is attempting to retrieve stolen eggs from a group of yellow villain birds. After hitting the villain birds, they vanish with a special effect. Strategic use of the environment and the properties of the objects in the game is key to progressing through the levels.
